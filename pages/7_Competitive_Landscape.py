st.subheader("🧭 How the Cruise Booking Market Operates Today")

st.markdown(
    """
Most global cruise booking platforms and online travel agencies (OTAs) are designed to **maximize booking volume**, not operational efficiency.

Common market characteristics:
- Heavy reliance on **discounts and promotions**
- Limited visibility into **route-level profitability**
- Focus on **selling inventory**, not optimizing it
- Operators receive **post-facto reports**, not real-time insights

st.subheader("⚠️ Key Challenges Faced by Cruise Operators")

st.markdown(
    """
Cruise operators operating through aggregators and OTAs often face:

- ❌ **High cancellation rates** with little early warning  
- ❌ **Over-dependence on a few partners or channels**  
- ❌ Difficulty identifying **underperforming routes and sailings**  
- ❌ Revenue leakage caused by **inefficient pricing and discounts**  
- ❌ Limited ability to compare **occupancy vs revenue quality**

st.subheader("📊 Why Traditional Reporting Is Not Enough")

st.markdown(
    """
Static reports and basic dashboards answer *what happened*,  
but **fail to explain what action should be taken next**.

Operators need:
- Benchmarks, not raw numbers  
- Early signals, not end-of-month summaries  
- Visibility into **risk**, not just performance
